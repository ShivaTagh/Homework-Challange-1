# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
BootCamp Homework - 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## The Challenges

To refactor an existing webpage in order to make it accessible, so it is optimized for search engines.

![Web capture_4-4-2023_145139_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127795324/229930773-18ed9920-7cca-4b2e-9f55-b0535a8c1a76.jpeg)

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Additional requirements for long term sustainability:
- Ensure all links are functioning correctly
- Clean up the CSS selectors and properties to make it efficient
  - Consolidate CSS selectors and properties
  - Organize CSS selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
  - Include comments before each element or section of the page

## The Process
In orther to accomplish the challege, the following steps were done:
- Understand clearly the webpage purpose and content
- Research sources to understand key concepts
  - What code refactoring is
  - Semantic HTML
  - Web accesibility standards
  - How to edit Markdown files
  - Proper use of a README.mb file
- Apply above concepts in the revision and editing of the HTML and CSS files

The specific findings and modifications to the HTML file
```
Structure and descriptive comments were added

<!-- Header -->

<!-- Main content -->

<!-- Additional content -->

<!-- Page footer -->


Changed <div>  for <header> tag

Changed <div>  for <nav> tag in HTML, and .header nav CSS rules

Changed to hero, and included into the header section.

Added some empty lines for making the HTML sections easier to identify


Added <main> tag to group the content

Added <footer> tag at the bottom of the page

The benefits <div> tag was changed to <aside> tag


Included alt properties with related description for each image

Changed the class search-engine-optimization to id search-engine-optimization

Changed the classes  benefit-lead, benefit-brand and benefit-cost to id benefit-lead, benefit-brand and benefit-cost

Removed the online-reputation-management class and rules in CSS updated to id

Removed the social-media-marketing class and rules in CSS updated to id

```
\
The specific findings and modifications to the CSS file
```
Structure and descriptive comments were added to the CSS file, and the css rules were clasified accordingly:

/* ================================= 
 Global rules and element rules
==================================== */


/* ================================= 
 Structural content style
==================================== */

/* ---------- The Header ---------- */

/* ---------- content ---------- */

/* ------- Additional content ------- */

/* --------- The Page Footer --------- */


The rules were ordered in terms of specificity to provide clearance in cascading rules application. Element rules first, then class selector rules and finally id selector rules.

Rules that were simplified into one rule (Replaced all class rules to id)

#search-engine-optimization, #online-reputation-management, #social-media-marketing {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    padding: 50px;
    height: 300px;
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    background-color: #0072bb;
    color: #ffffff;
}    

#search-engine-optimization img, #online-reputation-management img, #social-media-marketing img {
    max-height: 200px;
}

#search-engine-optimization h2, #online-reputation-management h2, #social-media-marketing h2 {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    font-size: 36px;
}

#benefit-lead, #benefit-brand, #benefit-cost {
    margin-bottom: 32px;
    color: #ffffff;
}

#benefit-lead h3, #benefit-brand h3, #benefit-cost h3 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
}

#benefit-lead img, #benefit-brand img, #benefit-cost img {
    display: block;
    margin: 10px auto;
    max-width: 150px;
}

Heading elements are shown in sequential order now.

Updated the header element.
.footer h4 {
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

## The Output
With the research, application of concepts, and specific changes made to the files, we were able to ensure an accesible, efficient, and easy to read project.
